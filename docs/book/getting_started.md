# Getting started
## Building from source
Dependencies:
- cargo
- rust

Building:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kelp-lang/kelp
cd kelp

cargo build --release
```
>_you can also add kelp into your path, although this is not currently recommended. As kelp is subject to change. If kelp reaches some level of maturity, I will maintain an AUR and will try to push it to other repos._
